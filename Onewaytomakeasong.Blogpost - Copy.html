      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 309.50px; height: 412.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 309.50px; height: 412.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Start with some solid poetry</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I like it when the chorus of a song is a little bit poetic and has some meaning</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s a good idea to not make it too specific. It leaves room for interpretation</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a good time to come up with a lyrical theme or idea for the song.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Try to sing a melody with this poetry and try to make it a little catchy</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">You might have to edit the syllables or rhyme pattern to make it more catchy and flow</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now focus on adding a bass line that fits the vibe of the lyrics and melody</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you want to add variation to the arrangement now is a good time to have a secondary and tertiary bass lines for verse and bridge etc</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now flush out those lyrical ideas with the respective bass lines.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reference the song writing cheat sheet to help write lyrics.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Think about variation with the rhythm of the bass, or you could worry about that later.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">NOTE: Don&#39;t underestimate the importance of sound selection. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The instruments you choose early on dictate the direction of the sonic vibes.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">NOTE: If you&#39;re really lacking in lyrics, consider having a post-chorus drop to fill out that time (which you can build in later)</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For now you can focus on what chords you&#39;ll have. It should be a lot easier now that you have melodic content from the vocals and a bass line.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">You just have to fill the space in between.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chords are pretty simple when you break it down.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Consider inversions, 7ths and 9ths, chromatic walk down/up chords, tension</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rhythmic anticipation, rhythmic delay</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arpeggiation</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Depending on how complex your chords are, you might want to add other harmonic and/or melodic layers using other instruments.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few ideas for some layers: Counter melody, Pad, Arpeggio, Plucks!</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The key idea is to fill out the sonic spectrum, different pitches, rhythms, and timbres.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example: if you have a short plucky sound that has a quick rhythm, try adding a long pad that plays a slower rhythm.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also consider how you might want to add variation by having different instruments for different sections</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">(this is a good/easy way to add variation especially if you only have one chord progression for the entire song)</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Extra melodic/harmonic tips:</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Panning!</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Consider some fx, Reverse, Reverse pitch delay, etc</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Granular synthesis &gt;.&gt;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Other resampling magic? idk</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">cheap trick!: switch to a higher octave for the chorus to add that energy! </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">(warning, this may create a frequency void that needs to be filled)</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point you should have a really strong harmonic/melodic foundation. Now it&#39;s time to focus on the percussion aspect.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not every song has drums. Consider the album blonde by Frank Ocean; many of the songs don&#39;t have drums. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not having drums emphasizes the dreamy vibes and allows u to focus more on the atmosphere and ambient textures.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if you really want a hit song, drums are key.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Drums can help guide the rhythm of the bass line, and vice versa.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Theres a few places to start with drums. First you could try to experiment with a few drum loops to see what vibes work</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you&#39;re lucky you can find a loop you really like and chop it up to add a little variation, </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">and layer it with some one shots and add effects to spice it up</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another technique is starting with one shots</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">You could try adding a perc loop or create your own perc loop using a glitchscape</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Extra perc tips:</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Panning! :)</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velocity/Volume is really important</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adding swing is a good way to get a funky bounce</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shaperbox is really good for adding movement, fx, or a little noise. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reversed perc sounds can really add some impact</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Experiment with some fx like delay, convolution, stretching, bitcrush, etc.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pitch shifting drums sounds can keep it interesting</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Silence is a great way to add rhythm and break up the melody</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Try changing the tempo all together</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">You could also get a little experimental with polyrhythmic patterns</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Consider side-chaining the kick ;)</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Try messing with transients and decay time.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Above all, don&#39;t be afraid to keep it simple, the key is to have a good sound selection.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">NOTE: if you&#39;re lacking inspiration, try listening to some good music :) </span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point, you&#39;re really deep in. Take a break. Step back and consider some key ideas:</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mixing, Texture, Arrangement, Melody, Rhythm, Purpose, Story, Transitions, Contrast, Cohesion.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you haven&#39;t already, now might be a good time to make sure you have enough vocal layers/harmonies, before things get to crazy.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Potential layers: main center vocal, L/R vocal doubles, background vocal with reverb, </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">multiple harmonies, ad-libs or secondary lyrics, different voices(whispering - screaming), vocoding!</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Make sure you adjust panning, and add different fx / eq to get the layers to sit in the mix and add some style.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s important to treat your voice like an instrument. Know it&#39;s limitations. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remember, keep it simple. Once you record your vocal layers consider taking some of it out :)</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another thing to consider is side-chaining the fx, especially for the main vocal. It helps the vocal to stand out.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before you add too much texture, it&#39;s a good time to consider resampling what you got to create some variation with low effort.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Resampling is also a great way to create transitions (using reverse echos)</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Other resampling ideas: Blurring, Chopping, Time stretching, Pitch shifting, Reversing.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finish the arrangement: At this point, you should have a strong foundation for your song. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Try adding any additional layers or effects that you think will enhance the overall sound.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noise:</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noise can be very thematic and add movie vibes or give character to the music</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or it can be much more subtle to add a little grit or vintagey warmth</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">SFX:</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">textural sfx can be similar to noise but more sparse and just add to the atmosphere</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">alternatively you can add more umph to your percussion. Something you cant quite do with effects or perc samples</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I differentiate percs and SFX. The key difference in my opinion is that SFX can act like a perc but they add more character</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">and a little bit more texture. In a way it can really emphasize a certain emotion. Percs often have less tonality to them compared to SFX.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, silly cartoon sfx can make things more funny.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While percs are more foundational to the drums as a whole.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">SFX allows for a connection between thematic/emotions to the percussion aspect of the song</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is similar to the concept of how the bass line can really connect the melodic/harmonic ideas to the rhythmic ideas. </span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Producer tags/ intro voice lines:</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">These can make your intros really iconic if thats the vibe you&#39;re going for. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s a great opportunity to add your own unique stamp that can get u recognized.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It also kinda acts as a cool transition sound and give off DJ set vibes, a great way to break up an album.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ask yourself how are different elements connecting to one another? </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps through another element, or through harmonic or rhythmic contrast, through key, through textural theme or timbre, perhaps Psychoacoustically.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">MIX/MASTER!:</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Solve problems you find, don&#39;t go looking for problems. There is a difference.</span></p>

      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cut lows and highs</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Use Maximus to widen mids and narrow lows</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Separate channel for fx on vocals to sidechain to main vocal</span></p>

      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">some amateur mistakes:</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Phase canceling your bass with other instruments like guitar. Side chain that baby so the guitar can have bass when there is no bass</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Putting too much reverb on drums - especially snares &gt;.&gt;</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">CHATGPT SUGGESTIONS:</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mixing is an essential part of the music production process. It allows you to shape and sculpt the individual tracks in your project into a cohesive and polished final product. There are a few key concepts to keep in mind when mixing to help you achieve the best possible results.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">First and foremost, it&#39;s important to focus on solving problems rather than looking for them. In other words, don&#39;t try to fix things that aren&#39;t broken. Instead, identify any issues with your mix and take steps to address them. This could include cutting excess low or high frequencies, using dynamic EQ to sidechain certain frequency bands, or using parallel processing to add saturation or distortion to specific tracks.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another important concept to consider when mixing is gain staging. This refers to the process of setting the level of each track in your mix so that it&#39;s neither too loud nor too quiet. Proper gain staging ensures that you have enough headroom to work with and can help prevent distortion and other issues.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mixing in mono can also be a helpful technique, as it allows you to focus on the overall balance and clarity of your mix rather than getting caught up in stereo effects. Similarly, mixing at a low volume can help you avoid fatigue and make better mixing decisions.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>Analyzing frequencies and the stereo field can also be useful when mixing. This can help you identify imbalances in your mix and take steps to correct them. For example, you might use a multiband compressor to even out the levels of different frequency ranges or use a mid-side EQ to boost the high frequencies on the sides of your mix.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Using reference tracks is another useful technique when mixing. By comparing your mix to tracks that you admire, you can get a better sense of how your mix stacks up and identify areas where you might need to make adjustments.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, don&#39;t forget about panning, which allows you to position different elements of your mix in the stereo field. This can help create a sense of depth and width in your mix and can be especially effective when used in combination with other mixing techniques such as multiband compression and saturation.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some common mistakes that amateur mixers might make include phase canceling the bass with other instruments like guitar, putting too much reverb on drums, especially snares, and failing to use sidechaining to control the levels of different tracks. By avoiding these pitfalls and keeping these mixing concepts in mind, you&#39;ll be well on your way to creating professional-sounding mixes.</span></p>
